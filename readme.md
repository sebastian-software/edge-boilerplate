## Usage

### Prerequisites

- `npm install`

### Create .env file

Copy the file .env-dev to .env before running any npm scripts.

### Production Build

Bundles and executes a server side React server. Initial rendering is taken place on the server for
optimal client side performance. The server also figures out the initial styles and scripts required for
rendering and allows the client to stream all these resources in parallel to other tasks.

- `run prod:start`

### Development Mode

Hot reloading server for client and server side React code. Offers very fast-paced development cycles
as everything is rebuild as needed and in most cases hot-injected into the running application.

- `run start`
